## Introduction

The collected data will be used to create final document, which could be an album with memories, travel journal or to other users an itinerary for their own trips. This will contribute to the creation of a community that shares itineraries with others and uses these already shared.

The main assumption of the application is to enable the consumer to conveniently and easily coordinate, document and plan travel with quick access to the necessary functions and data, which would help to enjoy the trip in a pleasant and clear way.
